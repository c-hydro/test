# The gitignore file lists files (and folders) that should be ignored by git.
# Best practice is to ignore:
## Generated Files (created in the build process, e.g. .pyc files)
## Sensitive Information (passwords or API keys, e.g. .config, .env files)
## User-Specific Files (including outputs of logs used for debugging)
## Build Artifacts and Output (also results of running your code, e.g. /bin, /build folders)
## Third-Party Libraries and Dependencies (including virtual environmen foldes such as /.venv or similar, DO commit a file that lists the dependencies, such as a requirements.txt)
